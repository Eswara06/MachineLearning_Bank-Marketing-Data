# MachineLearning_Bank-Marketing-Data

This project is pursued as a part of DSBA 6156- Applied Machine Learning Course. 

Dataset: The dataset I have chosen is Bank Marketing Data Set (url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). The dataset contains information about whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset contains 16 feature variables and a target variable.

-> I have performed basic exploratory data analysis, and written an executive summary of the data- a short paragraph explaining what the data is along with any characteristics that are important from a machine learning or business perspective.
-> Fit three different models on the data: a. A logistic regression classifier. b. A tree-based classifier (RF) c. A deep neural network.
